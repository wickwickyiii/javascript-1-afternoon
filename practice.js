//////////////////PROBLEM 6////////////////////

//Write a function called looper that takes in an array. looper should declare
//a variable called mySum and set it equal to 0. looper should then loop through
//the array and check each element.

//If the element is odd, or if the element is greater than or equal to 100, add the element
//to the mySum variable total.

//Return mySum.

//Code Here

//////////////////PROBLEM 7////////////////////

//Given the following function called math

function math(num1, num2, callback) {
  return callback(num1, num2);
}

//Write a function called add that takes in two parameters and
//returns the result of adding them together.

//Code Here

//Now invoke math, passing in the numbers 3 and 4, and your add function,
//storing the result in the variable mathSum.

//Code Here

//////////////////PROBLEM 8////////////////////

//Write a function called invoker that takes in one paramter, a callback function.
//invoker should return the result of invoking the callback.
